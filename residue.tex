\maketitle
Residue theory is a powerful tool to kill some integrals. Ideally, I'd prove everything I use, but we don't have the time for that on a Friday lecture, so I'll just do a few as examples.  To properly develop the theory we need some other stuff first....
\section{Complex Integrals}
Since in the complex plane, we're now on a plane, not a line, there is more than one way to get from one point to another. Therefore, almost all the integrals you see during this lecture are going to be contour integrals. We define an integral along some path in $\mathbb{C}$ the same way we do in multivar for $\mathbb{R}^2$. One really trivial thing you should realize is that:
\begin{thm}[Cauchy's Integral Theorem]
$\oint_C f(z) dz = 0$ 
\end{thm}
\begin{flushright}
if $f$ is analytic (a.k.a.\! conservative) inside $C$ and continuous on $C$.
\end{flushright}
\section{Cauchy's Integral Formula}
\begin{thm}[Cauchy's Integral Formula]
$\oint_C \frac{f(z)}{z-z_0} dz = 2\pi i f(z_0)$ 
\end{thm}
\begin{flushright}
if $f$ is analytic inside $C$.
\end{flushright}
\begin{proof}

Start with this contour, split as so:
$$\tilde C = C - C_\epsilon +\cancel{C_{+} + C_{-}}$$
\center{

}
$$\oint_{\tilde C} \frac{f(z) dz}{z-z_0} 
= 0 
=\oint_{ C} \frac{f(z) dz}{z-z_0} -\oint_{C_\epsilon} \frac{f(z) dz}{z-z_0}$$
$$\oint_{C} \frac{f(z) dz}{z-z_0} 
= \oint_{C_\epsilon} \frac{f(z) dz}{z-z_0}
= \oint_{C_\epsilon} \frac{f(z_0 + \epsilon e^{i\theta}) }{\epsilon e^{i\theta}} \epsilon i e^{i\theta} d\theta 
= i \int_0^{2\pi} f(z_0 + \cancelto{0}{\epsilon e^{i\theta}}) d\theta \rightarrow 2\pi i f(z_0) $$
\end{proof}
Note that for this to hold, $f$ has to be analytic, but not at $z_0$
\section{Laurent Series}
Now we can find something interesting if we try to develop Taylor Series using this fact, so let's do it! Let $t$ on some arbitary $C$. We're looking for an expansion in powers of $(z-a)$, with $a$ inside $C$. 
$$ f(z) = \frac1{2\pi i}\oint_{C} \frac{f(t) dt}{t-z} $$
$$\frac1{t-z} = \frac1{(t-a)-(z-a)} = \frac1{t-a}\frac1{1-{\frac{z-a}{t-a}}} = \frac1{t-a}\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac{z-a}{t-a}\right)^n $$
$$ f(z) = \frac1{2\pi i}\oint_{C} \frac{f(t) dt}{t-a} \sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac{z-a}{t-a}\right)^n  = \frac1{2\pi i} \sum_{n=0}^\infty{(z-a)}^n \oint_{C} \frac{f(t) dt}{(t-a)^{n+1}} $$
Now, if we write $f(z) = \sum_{n=-\infinty}^\infty A_n (z-a)^n$, we arrive at the nice results:
 $$f^{(n)}(a) = n! A_n$
 $$A_n = \frac1{n!2\pi i} \oint_{C}\frac{f(t) dt}{(t-a)^{n+1}}$$
We've proved this for positive n, but not for negative n. That proof is left as an excercise.
Since we also have negative powers of n, this expansion also works for functions that are not analytic, specificially, functions whose discontinuity is classified as a pole. The order of this pole is the the lowest n for which $A_n \not=0$ in the expansion. A pole of order $1$ is also called a simple pole. Futhermore the residue is defined, $$\res_{z=a} f(z) = A_{-1}$$
\section{Residues}
Here are three theorems that are useful and easy to prove:
\begin{thm}[Residues for simple poles]
If $f(z)=\frac{g(z)}{h(z)}$, $h(z_0)=0$, $h'(z_0)\not=0$, then $$\res_{z=z_0} f(z) = \frac{g(z_0)}{h'(z_0)}$$
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}[Residues for poles of higher order]
If $z_0$ is an $m^{th}$ order pole, 
$$\res_{z=z_0} f(z) = \lim_{z\rightarrow z_0} \frac1{(m-1)!} D_z^{m-1} \left[(z-z_0)^(m) f(z)\right]$$
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}[Cauchy's Residue Theorem]
If $f$ has isolated poles at $z_k$ inside $C$, and in analytic elsewhere inside $C$,
$$\oint_C f(z) dz = 2\pi i\sum_k \res_{z=z_k} f(z)$$
\end{thm}
\end{document}
